    "## Approach\n",
    "so, I had to use chatgpt to solve this problem as I had never used bit mask before. So, as it was explained by it, what it did was to make first the counter variable `count = {0:1}` this was followed by initializing the `bitwise` variable and `result` variable. Now, the first thing that we did here was we used XOR operation. XOR, in Logic gates at least stands for eXclusive OR, and gives a result of 0 when it is operated with 0 and 1 otherwise. So, atleast in terms of Logic Gates, it is shown by the following table: -\n",
    "\n",
    "| A | B | Output (A xor B) |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| 0 | 1 | 1 | \n",
    "| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "As such the code \n",
    "`bitwise ^= 1<<(ord(ch) - ord('a'))`\n",
    "would increment the position of the difference achieved from the value of the letter with a. So let us say for example, if we have the character 'a' in our word, then the code would get executed as follows\n",
    "`bitwise = bitwise ^ (1<<(ord('a') - ord('a'))`\n",
    "and that would give \n",
    "`bitwise = bitwise ^ (1<<0)`\n",
    "which would translate to operate 1 on the 0th position of bitwise vairable. which contains 0000000000 (10 zeroes). So, after the xor operation, the units place would become 1 (since xor of 0 and 1 is 1)\n",
    "so bitwise gets incremented the result of 0000000001.\n",
    "\n",
    "similarly, let us say if we had 'j' instead of 'a' we would have got, \n",
    "1<<(ord('j')- ord('a')) or 1<<9 or perform xor in the 9th position to get \n",
    "\n",
    "0100000001 = 513\n",
    "(given we have taken the word to be aj)"

    "Now we move to the count.get() method which retrives the instance of finding the bitwise operator. So, previously we had the bitwise operator as 0000000001 (for a), and it will retrive the instance of finding it. Since that operator is unique, it will return the value of 0 which is the default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the general principle for this code was that we only want 1 character with odd frequencies. It is okay to get more than one even frequencies, so if we get another character which is present in the dictionary of `count` all other subsets of the word would be classified as a wonderful word. This intution is represented by the code using the `tmp_bitwise` variable. The result would get incrimented if any tmp_bitwise vairable is found again on the dictonary. \n",
    "\n",
    "atlast we make a dictionary for that bitwise operator and increment the value of the occurence for that bitwise variable with 1 if it is the first time we see it. The code for this entire operation is given below, taking the example case of 'abj'"

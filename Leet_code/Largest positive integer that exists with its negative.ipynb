    "## Intuition\n",
    "so, Initially I had only 1 method to solve this problem, but later on after seeing the responses from other people who had provided their answers, I got 2 ways to solve this problem, with the 2 one have much lower time complexity than the initial solution that I had provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So the basic intution behind this problem is simple, We get some vairable, which we can assign some value of -1 (so that later on we can return the variable as default value if the test fails) and then we update this vairable after comparing with the other \n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "so, in my approach, The code is shown below. The code makes intutive sense. We first converted the list to set, because set has this unique property of creating a hash table and giving unique value to each entity therby making comparisions faster. After that we initialize the variable `max_k` to -1 and then we just applied the intution as it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "the for loop iterates through the set of nums and checks if the num is positive and if it and the -num of it exits in the set. If yes, then update the value of `max_k` with that number and check through the entire set. So as expected this has a time complexity of O(n) as this will keep on going until the entire set numbers are exhausted. "

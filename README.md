The following is a repository to help me get better at coding
So, how will I achieve this? 
- The first idea is to make code simpler, this could probably make it longer too as it would be present there to make it as easy to understand as possible
- The next step would be to make it more efficient, using Python libraries or anything possible, this could also include trying to understand other's solutions.


A similar structure would be followed for Kaggle as well. What I hope to achieve from this is to
- retain my knowledge of Python and possibly if I get questions like these, I would know how to solve them quickly and efficiently


since I do not know too much about coding, I will try and understand the code using ChatGPT and then write them here based on what I understood to further solidify the learning.

In the case of Kaggle notebooks, my explanation isn't provided yet because I am first doing the `Learn` part in the Kaggle and the notebooks are from there. The process for the codes in the Kaggle is also the same, but instead of a detailed code, it will only show the last code that I shortened according to logic and efficiency

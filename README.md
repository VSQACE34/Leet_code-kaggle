The following is a repository to help me get better at coding
So, how will I achieve this? 
- The first idea is to make code simpler, this could probably make it longer too as it would be present there to make it as easy to understand as possible
- The next step would be to make it more efficient, using Python libraries or anything possible, this could also include trying to understand other's solutions.


A similar structure would be followed for Kaggle as well. What I hope to achieve from this is to
- retain my knowledge of Python and possibly if I get questions like these, I would know how to solve them quickly and efficiently

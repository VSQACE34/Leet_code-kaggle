The following is a repository to help me get better in coding
So, how will I achieve this? 
- The first idea is to make code simpler, this could probably make it longer too as it would be present there to make it as easy to understand as possible
- The next step would be to make it more efficient, using python libraries or anything possible, this could also include trying to understand other's solutions.
The similar structure would be followed for kaggle as well. What I hope to achieve from this is to
- retain my knowledge of python and possibly if I get questions like these, I would know how to solve them quickly and efficiently
